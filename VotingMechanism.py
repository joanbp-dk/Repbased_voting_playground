        Abstract method to calculate the results of a voting process.

        This method should be implemented by subclasses for specific voting algorithms.
        It takes two parameters:
        - voters: A dictionary with each a voter ID, and each value is another dictionary
                  containing details about the voter.
        - voter_choices: A dictionary where each key is a voter ID and the value represents the
                         voter's choices or votes in the voting process.

        Returns:
            Result(s) of the voting calculation, of any type depending on the
            specific implementation (e.g., winner, ranked list of candidates, etc.).
