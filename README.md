# A playground for trying out voting algorithms

## Overview

This is my personal branch for experiments related to the TokenEngineering Academy's Reputation Weighted Voting course, the goal of which it is to come up with a suitable reputation based voting algorithm for electing a winner among four pre-selected fellowship candidates.

...But feel free to play around with the code on your own machine, and use it for any constructive purpose you can think of. 


## Files

* **[Concept.txt](Concept.txt)**

  Detailed explanation of the proposed voting concept.

* **[Voting.pdf](Voting.pdf)**

  A visual overview of the voting design.

* **[VotingMechanism.py](VotingMechanism.py)**

  Abstract class that represents a voting mechanism.

* **[GroupHug.py](GroupHug.py)**

  Implementation of the voting mechanism. This is where the actual action happens.

* **[Definitions.py](Definitions.py)**

  Basic structures used by the design.

* **[Testdata.py](Testdata.py)**

  A sample of votes that may be used for testing the voting mechanism. Mostly just intended to give an example. Define your own samples!

* **[Test.py](Test.py)**

  A small example test to show how to use the mechanism.

* **[Proofs.txt](Proofs.txt)**

  Arguments for the soundness of the design. More may be added when good questions come up.

## How to use

Running *[Test.py](Test.py)* in a Python interpreter will cause it to fetch a sample of test votes, run the GroupHug algorithm on the data and announce a winner.
